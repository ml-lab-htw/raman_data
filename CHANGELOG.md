## [1.6.2] — 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Skip live-network dataset downloads in CI tests to prevent flaky failures from
  external service timeouts (Zenodo, Kaggle, HuggingFace). Tests that bypass the
  HF mirror (e.g., `test_load_dataset`, `test_sugar_mixtures_low_snr`) now carry
  appropriate `pytest.mark.skip` or conditional `pytest.mark.skipif` decorators
  following the repo's existing convention.

### Changed

- README: rewritten introduction and contributing guidelines to improve
  accessibility for new contributors. Integrated docs-agent guidance for
  upstream-first documentation updates.
